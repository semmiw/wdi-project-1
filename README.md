                    Drakes and Ladders

Drakes and Ladders is a Drake-themed take on the classic children's board game, Snakes and Ladders. Players roll a die to determine how many squares to move their token. The token moves from the bottom of the board to the top left to right, then right to left on the next row and so on, until they reach the last square at the top of the board. The first player to reach "Home" or the last square wins the game.

If a player's token lands at the bottom of a ladder, they can move to the top of the ladder, advancing toward the goal. If the player's token lands at the head of a drake-snake, they must move to the tail, distancing them further from the goal. Every time a player hits a ladder or a drake-snake, a fact appears. There are three levels, each level lasts three rounds.
