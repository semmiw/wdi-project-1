                    Drakes and Snakes

Drakes and Snakes is a Drake-themed take on the classic children's board game, Snakes and Ladders. Players roll a die to determine how many squares to move their token. The token moves from the bottom of the board to the top left to right, then right to left on the next row and so on, until they reach the last square at the top of the board. The first player to reach "Home" or the last square wins the game.

If a player's token lands at the bottom of a ladder, they can move to the top of the ladder, advancing toward the goal. If the player's token lands at the head of a drake-snake, they must move to the tail, distancing them further from the goal. Every time a player hits a ladder or a drake-snake, a fact appears. There are three levels, each level lasts three rounds.  

## Main Features

* The game should be playable for one player, playing against the computer. Level Two will include two players.
* A pop-up window introducing users to the game and giving an option for player token preferences.
* A score board displaying rounds and player options.
* Audio Effects for winning/losing, button interaction, hitting a "drake-snake" or dancing drake icon, rolling the dice, and bonus rounds.
* The winner should be displayed when the game is over
* A window should appear asking if the player would like to play again.
* Animation: While player is moving across the board.
* Design Animation: Responsive design takes advantage of video and audio.  

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 with HTML5 audio
* CSS3 with animation
* JavaScript (ECMAScript6)
* jQuery
* Git
* GitHub
* Photoshop
* Trello

## Approach Taken

 I decided to primarily use vanilla JavaScript. I only took advantage of jQuery to help build the grid of the game board, player movement, and building out the dice roll functionality.

 * Styling

  I heavily leaned on a combination of CSS, animate.css and JavaScript to incorporate my animations. I also used a combination of block styling and flexbox to complete my layout.

## Wins and Blockers
 * I think the biggest win was actually getting the game done on time. I also was able to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript and Jquery fundamental through this project. The biggest challenges were being able to complete my styling/design on time, as well as not being able to incorporate the two-player feature.  

## Future Features

 I plan to make many upgrades to the project. Including:

 * Incorporating responsive design
 * Incorporating pop-up windows and alerts for winning, player selection and restarting the game
 * Incorporating more animation and sound effects for each square on the grid.
 * Adding animation for player movements: 'sliding' up and down, instead of appearing and reappearing.
